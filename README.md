## What is Buosl?
> ## abstract 
> As the name says, its a better ui for osl, basicly normal osl is executed but theres an extra step before app is deployed to run. Buosl will compile your `app.buosl` and transform it automagically to `app.osl`. You can always run `app.osl`. You can edit `app.osl` by compiling `app.buosl` again.
> :warning: You cannot convert `app.osl` to `app.buosl` even if the file didnt receive any other updates. Maybe in the future theres an app for it. 
> When `app.osl` is not available or you want  a different name, no problem, we will compile buosl to any file name with `.osl`.
